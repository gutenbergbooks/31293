<h2>
Systematic Status of a South American Frog,<br />
Allophryne ruthveni Gaige</h2>

<p class="center">BY<br /><br />

JOHN D. LYNCH AND HOWARD L. FREEMAN</p>


<p>Gaige (1926) described <i>Allophryne ruthveni</i> as a new genus and
species of diminutive bufonid from British Guiana. Noble (1931)
considered <i>A. ruthveni</i> to be a toothless relative of <i>Centrolenella</i>
and placed the genus in the Hylidae. Gallardo (1965) suggested
that <i>Allophryne</i> is a leptodactylid of uncertain affinities. Other
references to the monotypic genus have consisted only of a listing
of the name or of its inclusion in a key. To date the holotype and
one paratype (both females) have been reported (Gaige, 1926),
and the family position of the genus remains unsettled.</p>

<p>A male of <i>Allophryne ruthveni</i> is among the amphibians and
reptiles collected in southern British Guiana by William A. Bentley
in January, 1962, and deposited in the Museum of Natural History
at The University of Kansas (KU). Four additional specimens
(females) are in the American Museum of Natural History; only
one of the latter has definite locality data.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Acknowledgments.</i>&mdash;We are grateful to Dr. Ernest E. Williams, Museum of
Comparative Zoology (MCZ) and Dr. Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum
of Natural History (AMNH) for the loan of specimens. We are further indebted
to Dr. Zweifel for permission to clear and stain one specimen. Dr.
William E. Duellman and Linda Trueb offered many constructive criticisms.
Miss Trueb executed the drawings of the skull and finger bones. Mr. Martin
Wiley provided x-ray photographs of <i>Allophryne</i>.</p></div>


<h3>METHODS AND MATERIALS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Six of the seven known specimens were available for study. Measurements
were taken in the manner described by Duellman (1956). One specimen was
cleared and stained, using the technique of Davis and Gore (1936), in order
to study the skeleton. X-ray photographs were made of another specimen for
comparison.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined.</i>&mdash;Six, as follows: BRITISH GUIANA, <i>Dist. Demarara</i>:
Marudi Creek, AMNH 44749; <i>Dist. Equibo</i>: Tumatumari, MCZ 11790 (paratype);
<i>Dist. Rupununi</i> (<i>Berbice</i>): Wai Wai Country, N of Acarahy Mountains,
west of New River (2&deg;N, 58&deg;W), KU 69890. Also, 3 specimens from "probably
British Guiana," AMNH 70108-10 (70110 cleared and stained).</p></div>


<h3>SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT</h3>

<p>The availability of additional material and the new information
pertaining to osteology permit an amplification of Gaige's (1926)
description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Color.</i>&mdash;Dorsum gray with irregular network of black lines and elongate
blotches; flanks and labial region black with large white ocelli; dorsal surfaces
of limbs gray, marked as follows: two large, elongate white spots on each
thigh, concealed white spot on base of upper arm, black-edged gray transverse
bars on forearms and shanks, white spot on each knee and elbow; ventral surfaces
pale gray; black-edged white spot on ventral surface of thigh on each
side of anal opening; chin and throat dark gray with white spots; vocal sac
in male black (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>a and c).</p>

<p>Gaige (1926) briefly described the color, which conforms to the above in
all particulars. The paratype (MCZ 11790) has lost the gray color after 40
years in preservation; now (1966) the ground-color is cream-brown, and the
dorsal spotting, noted by Gaige as being black, is now brown.</p>

<p>The spots on the feet, tarsi, knees, thighs, flanks and upper arm are white
in preservative, but in life possibly were red or yellow. These colors usually
fade to white in preservative. Red or yellow spots are common aposematic
colors in frogs.</p>

<p><i>Variation.</i>&mdash;Eight measurements were taken on each specimen and four
ratios were computed; these are summarized in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Gaige's illustration
of the holotype shows that it has a greatly reduced pattern, whereas the paratype
and three of the other five known specimens have relatively large and
numerous spots. The male (KU 69890) and one female (AMNH 70108) have
a reduced pattern intermediate between that of the holotype and the four other
specimens.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

<h3>FAMILY POSITION</h3>

<p>The following characters of <i>Allophryne</i> are those generally held to be useful
in determining family relationships:</p>


<ol><li>Presacral vertebrae procoelus, eight in number.</li>

<li>Parahyoid absent.</li>

<li>Free ribs lacking.</li>

<li>Bidder's organ absent.</li>

<li>Intercalary cartilages present in digits; phalangeal formulae 3-3-4-4 and 3-3-4-5-4.</li>

<li>Coccyx articulating with sacrum by two condyles.</li>

<li>Tarsal bones not fused.</li>

<li>Pectoral girdle arciferal.</li>

<li>Epicoracoidal horns present, free.</li>

<li>Terminal phalanges T-shaped.</li>

<li>Sacrum procoelus and diapophyses expanded.</li>

<li>Maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers edentate.</li>

<li>Cranial roofing bones well ossified.</li>
</ol>

<p>Griffiths (1959) accorded considerable taxonomic weight to the presence or
absence of epicoracoidal horns in showing relationships among the genera
placed in the Brachycephalidae [= Atelopodidae; Dendrobatidae; and Leptodactylidae
(in part)] by Noble (1931). <i>Allophryne</i> possesses well-developed,
free epicoracoidal horns, such as those found in the Hylidae, Centrolenidae,
Leptodactylidae and Bufonidae.</p>

<p>The presence of intercalary elements in the digits is characteristic of the
Centrolenidae, Hylidae, Phrynomeridae, Pseudidae, and the rhacophorine
ranids (including the Hyperoliidae). This element is bony in the pseudids
and cartilaginous in the other families. Phrynomerids and rhacophorine ranids
lack epicoracoidal horns and have firmisternal pectoral girdles. Centrolenids
are small, delicate, arboreal frogs having poorly ossified skulls and fused tarsal
bones, but agree with <i>Allophryne</i> in having T-shaped terminal phalanges.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><img src="images/image002.png" width="600" height="326" alt="Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times; 40." title="Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times; 40." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. Dorsal (a) and lateral (b)
views of distal phalanges of third
finger of Allophryne. &times;&nbsp;40.</span>
</p>

<p>Only the presence of intercalary cartilages (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) suggests relationship of
<i>Allophryne</i> to the Hylidae. The T-shaped terminal phalanges suggest affinities
with centrolenids, elutherodactyline leptodactylids, or certain "brachycephalid"
frogs. Griffiths (1959) clearly showed that Noble's Brachycephalidae was a
polyphyletic assemblage. No hylid genus is edentate, and none has either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
T-shaped terminal phalanges or the unusual dorsal spinules. Perhaps the
presence of intercalary cartilages is not indicative of relationship but instead
is a parallelism (or convergence) in <i>Allophryne</i> and genera of the Centrolenidae.</p>


<h3>CRANIAL OSTEOLOGY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The skull of <i>Allophryne</i> (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) is distinctive among anurans; it does not
closely resemble the skulls of either hylids or centrolenids, both of which have
generally more delicate (except for casque-headed hylids, such as <i>Corythomantis</i>,
<i>Diaglena</i>, <i>Osteocephalus</i>, <i>Triprion</i>) and generalized skulls. <i>Allophryne</i>
on the other hand has a strongly ossified central region (cranial roofing
bones and sphenethmoid complex) and a weak peripheral zone. The peripheral
elements are reduced (maxilla, pterygoid, and squamosal) or absent (quadratojugal),
whereas the frontoparietals, nasals, sphenethmoid, pro&ouml;tics, and exoccipitals
form a compact central zone. An elongate frontoparietal fontanelle is
present.</p>

<p class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><img src="images/image003.png" width="600" height="567" alt="Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times; 12." title="Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times; 12." />
<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Dorsal view of skull of Allophryne (AMNH 70110). &times;&nbsp;12.</span>
</p>

<p>Dorsally (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), the premaxillae are not visible. The proportionally
gigantic septomaxillae are visible anterior to the nasals. The moderate-sized
nasals are separated medially and in broad contact with the ethmoid posteriorly.
The palatine process of the nasal does not meet the frontal process of the
maxilla. A large frontoparietal fontanelle is evident between the frontoparietals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
The tegmen tympani are much reduced and maintain only cartilaginous contact
with the posterior arms of the squamosals. The foramen magnum, occipital
condyles, and exoccipitals show no unusual features. The <i>pars facialis</i>
and frontal process of the maxilla are greatly reduced. The maxilla and
premaxilla are articulated. The high, narrow alary processes of the premaxillae
extend dorsally about two-thirds of the height of the snout. A cartilaginous
internasal septum is illustrated (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>), but sectioning is necessary to determine
the true nature and extent of this element.</p>

<p>Ventrally, the skull lacks palatines. The maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers
are edentate. The parasphenoid is large with relatively short, stout
alary (lateral) processes. The sphenethmoid is extensive in ventral aspect and
forms the major supporting structure in the anterior part of the skull. The
pterygoid has a broad articulation with the maxilla, a tenuous contact with
the squamosal, but is not attached to the pro&ouml;tic. The anterior (zygomatic)
process of the squamosal is greatly reduced (only about one-third the length
of the posterior process).</p></div>


<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

<p>The skull of <i>Allophryne</i> is definitely non-hylid. Most of the post-cranial
features do not help to clarify relationships. <i>Allophryne</i>
shares several osteological features with the Dendrobatidae:
T-shaped terminal phalanges, general cranial morphology and
procoelus vertebrae. But, the dendrobatids possess firmisternal
pectoral girdles and lack epicoracoidal horns. Also, no dendrobatid
has intercalary elements in the digits. We are, therefore, left
with a taxonomic enigma. In one or more characters generally regarded
as important, <i>Allophryne</i> differs from all presently defined
families of frogs. The Hylidae and Dendrobatidae are the only currently
recognized families in which the genus might be placed.</p>

<p>The function and taxonomic importance of the large septomaxillae
are unknown and are probably associated with the modification of
the sphenethmoid-prevomer area. A more detailed study of the
cranial osteology of <i>Allophryne</i>, especially the structural relationships
of the sphenethmoid-prevomer area may elucidate the relationships
of <i>Allophryne</i>.</p>

<p>The relationships of <i>Allophryne</i> cannot be understood without a
re-analysis of some of the features used as major criteria in frog
classification (the nature of an intercalated cartilage; the nature of
the sternal complex; the relative value of cranial osteology; the
vertebral structure; and the thigh musculature). Some of these
features have been investigated by other workers, most notably
Griffiths, but others have not and need re-examination. A re-analysis
of some of the major criteria used in frog classification is in progress
(Callison, Lynch, and Trueb) and upon completion of that study
we think the relationships of <i>Allophryne</i> will become apparent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span></p>
<p>A more comprehensive study of the cranial anatomy of certain
hylids, leptodactylids, dendrobatids, and atelopodids along with
that of <i>Allophryne</i> is needed to clarify the relationships of <i>Allophryne</i>,
and might indicate that the recognition of a fifth family is
necessary.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>Among currently recognized families of frogs, <i>Allophryne</i> is least
different from the Hylidae although it is our opinion that inclusion
of this genus in the Hylidae probably represents an unnatural classification.
However, the present evidence suggesting that <i>Allophryne</i>
should be in another family is less convincing than evidence suggesting
it should be in the Hylidae. We tentatively place <i>Allophryne</i>
in the Hylidae.</p>
